# Android-Simple-Calculator
This is android mini project. Main action is Simple Calculation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. However, I found an issue which is "android textfield cursor error" while developing it. That's why I solved this issue by using some java codes. If you have same problem like this, you may solve it or you can contribute by adding some new features and functions if you have better ideas.
